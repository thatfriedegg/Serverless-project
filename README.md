# Serverless-project
My serverless project to learn more about using API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB

This is my first standalone project to implement some of the practical knowledge that I have learned through my certification and online studies!

This is a microservice product test using API Gateway a backend on Lambda and a database on DynamoDB.

I used this service to insert data, read the data, update the data, and delete data.
